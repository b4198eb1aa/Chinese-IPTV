Chinese CCTV List (IPV6)

New features:
1. Complete TV stations list. (Thanks kunKun-tx, https://github.com/kunKun-tx/Chinese-IPTV)

If IPTV app supports remote path, such as PVR IPTV simple client in KODI, you
could use both files here, TV-EDU-HAUST.m3u and guide.xml. If your time zone is
Eastern Time Zone (UTC-5), EPG time shift is -5 because time in guide.xml is
UTC-0. Otherwise, you can change EPG time shift number according to your time
zone.
